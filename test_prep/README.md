🧪 Question 1 — Similar Level

Write a function that receives a list of temperature readings taken each day and separates them into two lists:

• one list of temperatures below 20
• one list of temperatures 20 and above

Input
[18, 22, 19, 25, 17, 20]

Expected Output
([18, 19, 17], [22, 25, 20])



🧪 Question 2 — Same Difficulty

Write a function that takes a list of words and returns a dictionary where:

key = word

value = length of that word

Input
["code", "python", "ai"]

Expected Output
{"code": 4, "python": 6, "ai": 2}




🧪 Question 3 — Slight Twist

Write a function that receives a list of numbers and returns a set of only the even numbers.

Input
[3, 6, 2, 7, 6, 10, 3]

Expected Output
{2, 6, 10}



🧪 Question 4 — Now we level up slightly

Write a function that takes a list of dictionaries representing students and returns a dictionary grouping students by grade.

Input
[
 {"name": "Lebo", "grade": "A"},
 {"name": "Mia", "grade": "B"},
 {"name": "Sam", "grade": "A"}
]

Expected Output
{
 "A": ["Lebo", "Sam"],
 "B": ["Mia"]
}
